## Possible Roadmap Items - Admin Related:
* Sort Column Headers in admin table
* Toggle boolean columns right in the admin table
* Add a map with all the countries and States/Provinces that I have a woodburning in
* Stats to the Admin Section
* When creating a new woodburning entry, have a image uploader option in the form so the images can be stored in the 
firestore's image storer
* Add ability for an admin to post, edit and delete blogs from the UI instead of it being written in a new html doc

## Possible Roadmap Items - Main Site:
* Implement the ability for someone to buy woodburnings from the For Sale page
    * Link to Square/Stripe/Paypal or something
    * Would need to gather shipping information
* Have ability to sort cards shown in the gallery and for sale page (by price, name, etc.)

## Up next: 
* Add content to the home page
* Add content to the about page
* Add more content to the Contact page
* Implement the For Sale page - even if it doesn't have the ability to be bought through my site - link to etsy
* Implement the Gallery page
